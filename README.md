# Getting Started with App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Developer Guidelines!

1.  State Management - Redux + React Hooks
2.  Vanilla CSS (Use SCSS Modules)
3.  Refrain from class components
4.  Do not put everything on redux
5.  Keep folder structure flat, do not make a lot of folders
    Example

```sh
    pages
      __tests__
        Homepage.test.js
      HomePage.js
    components
      __tests__
        button.test.js
      button.js
    business-components
      __tests__
        create-idea.test.js
      create-idea.js
    hooks
      __tests__
        use-confirmation-dialog.test.js
      use-confirmation-dialog.js
    services/ http-client
      http-client.js
```

6.  Use jest + React Testing Library for unit tests
7.  Do not write snapshot testing
8.  A component should not be more than 200 lines (you are doing something wrong, break it if its more than that)
9.  Reusable logic should be moved into hooks
